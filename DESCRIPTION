Description: Calculates insulin secretioin rates from C-peptide values
    based on the methods described in Van Cauter et al. (1992),
    "Estimation of Insulin Secretion Rates from C-Peptide Levels".
    Included functions calculate estimated insulin secretion rates using
    linear or cubic spline interpolation of c-peptide values (see Eaton et
    al., 1980, and Polonsky et al., 1986) and to calculate estimates of
    input coefficients (volume of distribution, short half life, long half
    life, and fraction attributed to short half life) as described by Van
    Cauter.
